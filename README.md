# Etch-a-Sketch

Welcome to Etch-a-Sketch! This is a web-based application that recreates the classic drawing toy, combining elements of a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. With this project, I aim to showcase my DOM manipulation skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Description

Etch-a-Sketch provides a user-friendly interface where you can draw pixelated images on a 16x16 grid of square divs. The application allows you to hover your mouse over the grid, leaving a trail behind, just like using a pen on a sketchpad. Each square changes color as you move your mouse over it, giving you the freedom to create unique designs.

## Key Features

- Dynamic creation of grid divs using JavaScript
- Utilization of flexbox to create a grid layout
- Implementation of hover effect to change the color of grid divs
- Integration of a button for user input to generate a new grid with a specified number of squares per side
- Limiting the user input to a maximum of 64 squares per side to optimize performance

## Additional Block Creation Styles

- Normal Black or White: Create blocks with a standard black or white color, perfect for classic sketches.
- RGB Random: Generate blocks with randomized RGB values, allowing for vibrant and dynamic drawings.

*Note: These additional block creation styles will be implemented as part of future updates to the application.*

## Skills Demonstrated

- DOM manipulation using JavaScript to dynamically create and modify HTML elements
- Applying CSS styles to achieve the desired layout and visual effects
- Handling user interactions through event listeners and JavaScript functions
- Working with user input using HTML forms and prompts
- Utilizing Git and GitHub for version control and project collaboration

Feel free to explore, contribute, and provide feedback on this project. I hope you enjoy using Etch-a-Sketch as much as I enjoyed creating it!
